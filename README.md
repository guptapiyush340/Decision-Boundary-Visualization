# Decision-Boundary-Visualization
Visualizing how predictive algorithms works can be challenging at times. With more focus on mathematics, we tend to miss out of intuition behind these models. Generating decision boundaries for different hyper parameter values can not only improve our understanding but also help to overcome over fitting..
